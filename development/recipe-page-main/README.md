## My process

I have:

1. Read about the project and its specifications.
2. Thought of potential problems and about the general layout.
3. Created HTML file and included all the elements according to the provided screenshots.
4. Linked the external CSS file with HTML file, added all outside files (fonts, images).
5. Created the general layout of the page with flexbox for the main container and position absolute for the footer.
6. First styled the body, defined all colors as variables for future use, then styled the recipe card starting from the outside and going inwards from top to bottom to style all all smaller elements.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I have reinforced:

- CSS flexbox for general and more detailed layout
- creating table in HTML
- styling li::marker
