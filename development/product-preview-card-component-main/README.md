## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge was to build out a product preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible. It also included creating a responsive layout for different screen sizes, and adding hover and focus states for interactive elements.

## My process

I have:

1. Learned more about responsiveness (em & rem units; width & max width properties).
2. Read about the project and its specifications.
3. Thought of potential problems and about the general layout.
4. Created HTML file and included all the elements according to the provided screenshots. I've added classes to elements using BEM naming convention.
5. Linked the external CSS file with HTML file, added all outside files (fonts, images).
6. Defined colors and fonts as variables in CSS.
7. First styled the body, then styled the card layout, starting with mobile and then setting the desktop layout in media queries and in general; then I've styled smaller elements starting from the outside and going inwards from top to bottom.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- BEM naming convention for CSS
- media queries

### What I learned

I have been learning more about responsive layout and used that knowledge to:

- write more complex media queries,
- avoid setting fix heights and width,
- avoid using fix units and use rem, em and % instead,
- used html picture element to set different images for different screen sizes,
- used em for margins and padding in elements where I wanted those values to be responsive with accordance to its font-size value.
